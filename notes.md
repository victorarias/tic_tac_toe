- Deciding between double or models wasn't easy for this app. Some models like `TicTacToe::Position` are so simple that I believe that using them makes the specs tell a better story.
- Dealing with repeating interaction at `TicTacToe::ChoosePlayerMark` was tricky. It's never easy to stub multiple calls to the same method.
- A position on the board could be extracted as its own class, so the board would store a plain array of something like `BoardCell` with its position and state. That make the code inside `Board#available_positions` much simpler.
